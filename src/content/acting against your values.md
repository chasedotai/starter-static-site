### Acting Against Your Values

Is it possible to act against your values?

Are your actions the ultimate indicator of your values, or is it possible to truly hold a value, but to act inconsistently with it?

The question seems philosophical, but it has practical impact. If you believe that you can hold one value, but act another way, then you are leaving the potential of [[practical values]] on the table. You're shortchanging yourself. The power of values is in how they influence your behavior. By creating a closer link between your values and your behavior, you can take greater control of your destiny.

On the flip side, watching your behavior can help you learn valuable information about yourself if you believe what you see. If you are convinced that you can act one way, but hold other values, then you are cheating yourself out of using a valuable signal. 

In my observation, almost everyone is acting in contradiction to their stated values almost all the time. Or, even more commonly, the majority of actions that people take seem, to them, to be outside the realm of values at all. They go around most of their day doing actions driven by something they would not describe as values, whose foundations they have not explored or tapped into.

Our values are always there, underlying every moment and facet of our lives. We can ignore them most of the time, and be on autopilot, but this has consequences. We are influenced more easily by those around us. Others who have deepened their relationship with their values and claimed greater agency in their lives will, without even trying, set the direction of your life.
