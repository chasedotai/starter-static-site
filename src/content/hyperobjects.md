## What are hyperobjects?

There is probably a definition of the word hyperobject on the internet, but I have not read it. I learned it from a meme that was going around in the format of "The hyperobject at the end of time is a...."

The original template upon which this entire website is based used the words "digital garden" to frame the site as something that would grow and change over time. This framing has an organic, skeuomorphic, gentle, naturalistic vibe. I don't mind that, but it wasn't exactly how I felt about what I was building at the time. I was building out both the static site builder that generates this site, as well as writing the content itself. I was writing new things to test out various features of the site. For example, I started writing this text you are reading as a way of testing how well it would work to edit a markdown file directly in an Obsidian vault and then deploy it to Github Pages. As I was doing this work, I kept thinking about the word hyperobject. I did not feel like I was tending a garden, planting seeds that would then grow slowly with sustenance. I felt like I was building a machine that could then build machine parts that could be used to extend the original machine. 

I wanted my website itself to have a similar feature to something that Obsidian itself does, which is that when I add a hyperlink to another note, within a piece of writing that I am doing, Obsidian will check whether there is anything at the location my hyperlink points to. If not, Obsidian will create a blank document at that location, using the text of my hyperlink as the filename and title of the document. I love this feature of Obsidian. It lets me open up new avenues of inquiry, or mark new paths I want to go down without having to go down them immediately. If I'm excited about a path I mark, I can immediately click the hyperlink I just created, go to the blank document, and start typing there! 

For me, this is a hyperobject. It is a labyrinth I can enter, in which I can create new paths that previously didn't exist, go down those paths and build them as I go, then work my way back, if I so desire.
