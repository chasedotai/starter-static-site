# Welcome to my digital garden ðŸŒ±

This is my personal space for thoughts, notes, and explorations. Unlike traditional blogs, this is a space that grows and evolves over time, much like a garden.

## What you'll find here

Here you'll find my notes on:

- Web Development
- Technology
- Personal Knowledge Management
- And other topics that interest me

Feel free to explore and watch how these thoughts grow over time. Start with the [[blog|rabbit holes]] I've gone down.
